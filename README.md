Our aim is to create an outstanding gaming experience while adhering to industry best practices for code organization, performance optimization, and maintainability.

**Key Features:**
- Engaging Gameplay: Experience a thrilling adventure with a captivating storyline, stunning visuals, and seamless controls.
- Robust Architecture: Follows a well-structured and modular architecture, making it easy to understand, extend, and maintain the codebase.
- Performance Optimization: Utilizes efficient algorithms and techniques to ensure smooth gameplay and optimal resource utilization.
- Version Control: Uses Git for easy collaboration, enabling seamless teamwork and effortless tracking of changes.
- Documentation: Provides comprehensive documentation, including a detailed README and code comments, to facilitate understanding and contribute to the project.

**Contributions:**
We welcome contributions from the open-source community to enhance the game further. If you are passionate about game development, feel free to submit bug fixes, feature requests, or even contribute new gameplay elements. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute effectively.

**Getting Started:**
To get started with the Awesome Unity Game project, please refer to the README file. It contains step-by-step instructions on how to set up the development environment, install dependencies, and run the game locally.

**Naming Conventions and Code Guidelines:**
We're following the official Microsoft guidelines for C# code. You can refer to [the official guideline page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/coding-conventions) for full details.
Here the naming conventions we're using:
* **Namespaces**: PascalCase
* **Classes**, **Structs** and **Records**: PascalCase
* **Interfaces**: IPascalCase
* **Public**, **Protected** and **Internal** for fields, properties and methods: PascalCase
* **Private** for fields, properties and methods: _camelCase
* **Constants**: PascalCase
* **Parameters**: camelCase
* **Local variables**: camelCase
* **Generic type parameters**: T
* **Public**, **Protected** and **Internal** statics: PascalCase
* **Private Statics**: s_pascalCase 
* **Threaded Private Statics**: t_pascalCase

**And some of the important guidelines include:**
* 4 characters indentation, no tabs (which is default in most IDEs)
* only one statement or declaration per line
* continuation lines are indented by 4 characters
* no space between method name and opening parenthesis
* implicit usage is preferred over explicit usage
* place comments on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code
* Ensure all public, protected, and internal members are documented


> So an example of a class would be:
> ```csharp
> namespace MyNamespace
> {
>     /// <summary>
>     /// This interface serves as an example
>     /// </summary>
>     public interface IMyInterface
>     {
>         /// <summary>
>         /// MyMethod is an interface method with one parameter. 
>         /// </summary>
>         void MyMethod(int myParameter);
>     }
> 
>     /// <summary>
>     /// This class serves as an example.
>     /// </summary>
>     public class MyClass
>     {
>         /// <summary>
>         /// This is a public field.
>         /// </summary>
>         public int MyPublicField;
> 
>         /// <summary>
>         /// This is a private field.
>         /// </summary>
>         private int _myPrivateField;
>         
>         /// <summary>
>         /// This is a public property.
>         /// </summary>
>         public string MyPublicProperty { get; set; }
> 
>         private string _myPrivateProperty { get; set; }
> 
>         /// <summary>
>         /// This is a constant.
>         /// </summary>
>         public const int MyConstant = 10;
> 
>         private static string s_myPrivateField = "Hello";
> 
>         [ThreadStatic]
>         private static string t_myPrivateField = "World";
>         /// <summary>
>         /// This is a public method with one parameter.
>         /// </summary>
>         public void MyMethod(int myParameter)
>         {
>             var myLocalVariable = "Local Variable";
>             var myGenericList = new List<int>();
>             // or
>             List<int> myGenericList2 = new();
>         }
>     }
> 
>     /// <summary>
>     /// This struct serves as an example.
>     /// </summary>
>     public struct MyStruct
>     {
>         // ...
>     }
> 
>     /// <summary>
>     /// This record serves as an example.
>     /// </summary>
>     public record MyRecord(
>         int MyProperty,
>         string MyOtherProperty); 
> } 
> ```
